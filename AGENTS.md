# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Root Gradle setup with single Android app module `app`. Settings in `build.gradle.kts`, versions via `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (managed by `libs` catalog).
- Source under `app/src/main/java/com/example/rewardsrader`; Compose theme files live in `ui/theme`.
- Resources in `app/src/main/res` (values, icons, XML rules). Product docs live in `docs/` (e.g., `product_functionality.md`), tooling in `tools/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `./gradlew assembleDebug` – compile the app and produce a debug APK.
- `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` – run JVM unit tests.
- `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` – run instrumented UI tests on an attached/emulated device.
- `./gradlew lint` – run Android lint checks.
- Android Studio: use Compose Previews for quick UI iteration; standard Run/Debug targets use the `debug` build variant.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose; prefer idiomatic Compose patterns (state hoisting, unidirectional data flow, small composables).
- Indent with 4 spaces; keep lines concise and readable. Favor expression-bodied functions when clear.
- Package paths mirror features; keep `MainActivity` lean and move UI/state into feature packages as they grow.
- Use Material 3 components and the shared theme (`RewardsRaderTheme`) for colors/typography. Name composables as `FeatureActionScreen`, `FeatureActionCard`, etc.
- Features are modularized; avoid oversized single files—split UI/state/data by feature as they grow.
- Instead of creating your own code, search for open-source libraries that can achieve the goal. downlod it to `reference` folder and use it.

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit tests: JUnit4 in `app/src/test/java`; name files `<Subject>Test.kt`. Aim to cover viewmodels/use-cases as they appear.
- Instrumentation/UI tests: Compose UI Test + Espresso in `app/src/androidTest/java`; name files `<Subject>AndroidTest.kt`. Use `composeTestRule` with semantics tags for stable selection.
- Keep tests deterministic; avoid network/file side effects. Use fakes for data sources when added.

## Config & Data Notes
- Card/benefit templates come from a maintained JSON/YAML config (see `docs/product_functionality.md`). Ship a bundled snapshot and allow optional URL/local overrides with validation and caching.
- Store only non-sensitive card details; if sensitive identifiers are ever added, gate them behind local encryption/biometric unlock.

## Mandatory Pre-work for Agents
- Read `docs/product_functionality.md`. overall functionality.
- Read `docs/architecture.md`. general rules for project structure.
- Read`docs/feature_implementation_plan/index.md`. feature implementation plan index.
- Read`schema.prisma`. system / database structure. 

## Logging
- Do not read any files in `log` folder, you should write only, unless requested.
- You should log what you did, current progress and conversation when you are told to do so.
- Log what features implemented, what changes you made to each file, progress so far in `log/progress.md`.
  - for example: [12/01/2026 11:34PM] Removed benefit start/end dates from profile benefit links.
- Log our full conversation into `log/conversation-log.md` with date and time followed by message.
  - for example: [12/01/2026 11:34PM] User: hello. [12/01/2026 11:34PM] Assistant: hi.
