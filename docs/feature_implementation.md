## Card (step-by-step, pending unless checked)
- [x] Creation flow: Select issuer then card product; app loads the correct template based on selection (single template for now). Add minimal form for open date, statement cut, status, welcome-offer progress.
- [x] Card index page
- [x] Card face display: Show built-in card face on list/detail (placeholder asset now; replace later).
- [x] Editable fields: Allow editing all fields except issuer (fixed after creation); no validation initially.
- [x] Delete behavior: Delete card and all attached data (benefits, applications, usage, notifications) with an undo snackbar.
- [x] Welcome offer UI: Show spending progress bar and deadline (reminder integration deferred).
- [x] Card management: Update card details; confirm destructive actions and refresh state.

### Card creation search experience (implementation plan)
1) State & data: extend `CardCreateViewModel` to expose a searchable list of template cards from Room (id, issuer name, product, network, segment, payment instrument, annual fee, benefit tags). Track search query, sort mode, filter selections, and derived filtered/sorted list plus counts. Persist open date as UTC while formatting/displaying in the device’s local time.
2) Layout: convert the create screen to a search-first layout with a top search text field and back action; under it, show `Sort` and `Filter` chips/buttons (with active-count badges) and a small summary row (result count, clear filters). The main area is a `LazyColumn` of card results (face thumbnail when available, issuer/product title, network/segment chips, annual fee badge); include empty/loading states.
3) Sort bottom sheet: modal with radio options for Alphabetical (A→Z product), Issuer → Product, Annual fee (low→high, high→low), and Network; persists choice and updates the list immediately.
4) Filter bottom sheet: sections for multi-select issuer, network chips, segment (personal/business), payment instrument (credit/debit/charge), annual fee slider + toggle for “no annual fee,” and benefit type/category chips (credit vs multiplier, top categories). Provide Reset and Apply actions; show active filter count on the trigger chip.
5) Card selection & creation: tapping a result immediately creates the card via the importer (prefilling issuer/product/card face, defaulting open date to current date stored in UTC and status to `pending`, leaving optional fields blank) and navigates to the Card List on success with a snackbar; on failure, stay on the search screen and show an error snackbar.
6) UX polish: debounce search input, keep keyboard dismissal consistent when opening sheets, ensure focus/IME padding does not cover chips, and make list + sheet behavior resilient to long catalogs (bounded sheet heights, remembered scroll state).
7) Testing: unit tests for viewmodel filtering/sorting combinations and debounced search; UI tests for search query filtering, sort/filter sheet interactions, empty state, and selecting a card to open/save the details form.

## Card Detail Screen
- [ ] `Change product` button at the top bar.

## Benefit (pending unless checked)
- [x] Benefit management: Add/update/remove benefits on a card; confirm destructive actions and refresh state.
- [x] Benefit types/properties: Support two types:
  - Credit: fixed amount; refresh cadence (once/monthly/quarterly/annual); category/merchant; notes/terms. One-time credits use a checkbox; multi-use credits store each credit amount used.
  - Multiplier: decimal rate (e.g., 0.05 for 5%/5x), optional cap on spend only; refresh cadence; category/merchant; notes/terms.
- [x] Categories: Store issuer-scoped categories (e.g., “Dining (Chase)”, “Online Shopping (Amex)”) from a selectable list of common types (Dining, Grocery, Online Shopping, Travel, Gas, Drugstore, Streaming, Transit, Utilities) with ability to add custom types; support multi-select per benefit and only show categories for the benefit’s issuer.
- [x] Usage tracking UI: Multiplier tracks spend amount and derived rewards per transaction; credits track checkbox for single-use or per-use amounts for multi-use; history with `MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm` UTC stored, local display.

## Offers
- [x] Offer management: Free-form per user with its own Room entity; add/update from a dedicated screen; delete from the offer item.
- [x] Offer fields: 
  - Title (required) (string)
  - note (string),
  - start date, 
  - end date, 
  - type (credit or multiplier) (enum), 
  - minimum spending (decimal, up to 2 decimals) , 
  - maximum cash back (decimal, up to 2 decimals).
- [x] UI patterns: Separate offer screen that reuses existing modal patterns, enforces required validation, and clears the form after save.
- [ ] Reminder support: Add reminders for offers in a later step.

## Local Notification

### Tracker
1) **Notification Manager & Channel**: Create a `NotificationHelper` to initialize a "Tracker Reminders" notification channel with appropriate importance. Implement `showNotification` taking title, body, and a target `PendingIntent` for navigation.
2) **Broadcast Receiver**: Create `NotificationReceiver` to handle `AlarmManager` intents. It should extract tracker IDs, fetch tracker/card details from the database, ignore non-active trackers (completed/expired), and clear any remaining reminder schedules for inactive trackers.
3) **WorkManager Integration**: Update `TrackerRefreshWorker` to also handle notification scheduling. After generating or updating trackers:
   - Identify active trackers with an upcoming `endDateUtc`.
   - Use `AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` when permitted, otherwise fall back to an inexact alarm.
   - Persist scheduled alarm IDs or timestamps in a new notification scheduling table to avoid redundant alarms.
4) **Reminder List UI**: Replace the toggle with a reminders list in `TrackerEditScreen`. Users can add multiple reminders (1-7 days) via a plus icon and remove reminders via a trash icon per list item. Do not preselect any reminder option, and prevent duplicate reminder offsets.
5) **Schedule Timing**: Reminders fire at 12:00 am local time on the chosen day offset. Example: if a tracker ends on 06/30 and reminder is 1 day before, fire on 06/29 at 12:00 am.
6) **Boot Receiver**: Implement a `BootReceiver` to reschedule all active tracker alarms when the device restarts, as `AlarmManager` alarms are cleared on reboot.
7) **Permissions**: Handle `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+) and `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` (Android 12+) permission requests in the UI (e.g., when adding a reminder).
8) **Deep Linking**: Ensure the notification `PendingIntent` navigates directly to the specific `TrackerEditScreen` by `trackerId`.

## App Settings / Platform
- Config refresh (remote/local): Manual refresh from URL/local JSON with schema validation, hash/signature check, and “last known good” rollback; update template catalog only.
- Auth and sync: Optional sign-in and cloud backup/sync; keep sensitive card info encrypted locally.
- Data import/export: Export user data to JSON; import with validation and duplicate handling.
- Accessibility/testing: Add semantics tags for Compose UI tests; improve empty/error/loading messaging and color contrast.

## UI
- Card faces: Display built-in card face images on list/detail; start with placeholder/fake assets, replace with official later.
- Visual polish: (Discuss later) layout refinements, typography, and component styles once assets are chosen.
- Selection UI: Use modal dialogs for option selection (type, frequency, status, etc.) with radio-button rows that accept taps on the entire row/label. Do not add a close button.
- After entity creation or editing, clear the input fields or set them to default value.
- 12dp / bodyMedium is the smallest acceptable font size.

## Card Configuration
- Split config by issuer (e.g., `chase.json`, `citi.json`), still validated/merged to a single in-app catalog at load time.
- On first launch, download configs and cache locally; allow users to edit local configs.
- Add a “Sync” button to pull remote configs and override local configs only (user-added cards remain untouched).
- Provide schema validation across merged configs and a “last known good” fallback to avoid corrupting the catalog.

## User Card List
Default page when page starts. Displays all user added cards.
- [ ] Card summary: 5/24, number of cards, and more
- [ ] Filters: Combined filters for issuer, benefit type, and annual fee on the card list.
- [ ] Search: Add search bar on the card list.

## All Card List

- [x] Filters: Combined filters for issuer, benefit type, and annual fee on the card list.
- [x] Search: Add search bar on the card list.

## Firebase Cloud Firestore support

- cloud to local
  - [x] Load card templates
  - [ ] Load user data after logging in.

## Authentication
- [ ] use google account to login.

## Profile
- [ ] multiple profiles for each user

## Tracker
- [x] Access through bottom navigation bar with two entries: Cards (default) and Tracker.
- [x] Tracker data sources:
  - Credit-type benefits from profile cards (ignore multiplier benefits).
  - Offers from profile cards (use tracker completion instead).
  - SUB (sign-up bonus) from profile cards with spending + duration configured.
- [x] Tracker model:
  - Each benefit or offer generates one tracker per period window.
  - Trackers own their own transaction list; do not reuse benefit transactions.
  - Display per tracker: card name, benefit/offer name, amount, and time left until end date.
- [x] Status rules:
  - Active: transaction total < tracker amount and before end date.
  - Complete: transaction total >= tracker amount; for offers, user can also mark complete via a checkbox.
  - Expired: end date passed with transaction total < tracker amount.
  - Example: a monthly benefit for Jan that is not used before Feb is marked Expired.
- [x] Period window generation:
  - For credit benefits, create trackers based on benefit frequency (monthly/quarterly/annual/anniversary/etc) without start/end date constraints.
  - For offers, create a single tracker using offer start/end dates.
- [x] UI:
  - Tracker screen shows three lists: Active, Complete, Expired. Each list can be accessed by tapping the filter chip at the top of the screen.
  - Tapping a tracker opens a Tracker Edit screen where users add transactions (amount/date/notes) and manage completion for offers.
  - Tracker screen uses the default profile (`default_profile`).
