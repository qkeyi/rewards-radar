User: ok so lets start with a introduction of the purpose of this android project. The users can add their credit cards with benefits of cash back, credits, etc. so users can see what credit cards did they apply, when did they apply, what benefits can they get. here's a IOS version of it as an reference. https://www.uscardforum.com/t/topic/268081. Integrating the  posts, and write a documents of how will the app functioning and what are the features.
Assistant: Captured a functional overview for the Android app and noted open questions where the iOS reference would help. Added docs/product_functionality.md with purpose, target users, core features, entities, flows, assumptions/next steps.

[2026-01-11 20:14:56 -08:00] Assistant: Tightened bottom sheet height to a fixed half-screen cap and removed extra fill-height usage to avoid transparent space.
[2026-01-11 20:47:28 -08:00] Assistant: Ensured face picker click hides the sheet via coroutine to close cleanly after selection.
[2026-01-11 20:48:37 -08:00] Assistant: Stopped prematurely toggling sheet visibility so the hide animation can play before dismissal.
[2026-01-12 11:12:59 -08:00] User: I would like to update card creation screen. the new card creation screen looks like a card searching screen. it has sort and filter options bottom sheet and a searching result list taking most spaces in card creation screen. I want you to write a implementation plan for this new card creation screen in `docs/feature_implementation.md`, including UI layout and functional feature.
[2026-01-12 11:12:59 -08:00] Assistant: Added a search-first card creation implementation plan (search bar, sort/filter bottom sheets, result list, selection-to-form flow, testing) in docs/feature_implementation.md and logged changes in progress/architecture docs.
[2026-01-12 11:47:09 -08:00] User: for the fifth point: tapping a result add the card directly and navigate the user to Card list.
[2026-01-12 11:47:09 -08:00] Assistant: Updated the plan so tapping a search result immediately creates the card via the importer and returns to the Card List with snackbar feedback; logged in feature_implementation, progress, and architecture docs.
[2026-01-12 11:51:21 -08:00] User: set open date to current date, set status to `pending`.

[2026-01-12 11:54:45 -08:00] Assistant: Asked clarifications on optional fields, error handling, and UTC vs local storage/display for open date.
[2026-01-12 11:54:45 -08:00] User: 1. skip all optional fields and leave them as blank. 2. yes. 3. you should save UTC in database but display device local time.
[2026-01-12 11:54:45 -08:00] Assistant: Incorporated clarifications into the plan: optional fields stay blank, failures remain on search with error snackbar, open date saved in UTC and shown in local time; updated feature_implementation, progress, and architecture docs.
[2026-01-12 12:19:41 -08:00] User: proceed with next step
[2026-01-12 12:19:41 -08:00] Assistant: Implemented the search-first card creation experience with search/sort/filter UI, immediate create (UTC open date, pending status, optional fields blank), success navigation/snackbar wiring, template-benefit filter metadata, and updated unit test; logged updates and ran the create viewmodel test.
[2026-01-12 13:55:28 -08:00] User: I don't want the the filter bottom sheet to cover the entire screen. give some spaces between top bar and top edge of filter bottom sheet.
[2026-01-12 13:55:28 -08:00] Assistant: Capped the filter bottom sheet to 85% height so it leaves top spacing below the app bar; test suite for CardCreateViewModel still passing.
[2026-01-12 14:10:00 -08:00] User: in filter sheet, there are more fields below but due to some reasons i can not scroll to the bottom.
[2026-01-12 14:10:00 -08:00] Assistant: Made the filter sheet content scrollable so all filters are reachable; tests still pass.

[2026-01-15 13:54:15 -08:00] Assistant: Moved the Add card action to a Material 3 floating action button on the card list screen and removed inline Add card buttons from list/empty states; logged updates.
[2026-01-15 14:07:43 -08:00] User: in my card list screen, make the snackbar shows at the very bottom, but when snackbar shows, shift the `add card` button up. just like the snackbar and FAB behaviors in the card detail benefit or offer tab content
[2026-01-15 14:07:43 -08:00] Assistant: Matched card list snackbar/FAB behavior to card detail by anchoring the FAB in content with animated bottom padding when a snackbar is visible and added list bottom padding to prevent overlap; logged updates.
[2026-01-15 15:09:05 -08:00] User: update card item layout in my card list. first row is a full width selected card face with only 20% from top displayed. second row contains card name followed by last four digit (for example "...7861") and at the most right of second row is the `delete` button. third row contains the duration of holding the card, use units of years, months and days. To be more clear, consider second and third row as a group that overlaps on the first row. first row only shows part of the card face which is 20% from top displayed. -- before you start, do you have any questions?
[2026-01-15 15:09:05 -08:00] Assistant: Asked clarifying questions about card face source, last-four display, duration basis, crop behavior, and status placement.
[2026-01-15 15:09:05 -08:00] User: 1. use whatever url used in card detail. not sure if it's available in CardSummaryUi, if not include it. 2. show if present, do not show if missing. 3. it should be openDate to today. update the label name, it's actually not holding duration, but something like how long has it been since the card get approved. Spell the whole unit word, like years, months, days. 4. show top 20% of the card face. 5. add card status to the last row.
[2026-01-15 15:09:05 -08:00] Assistant: Updated the card list UI model and layout to show the cropped card face strip, overlapping name/last-four/delete row, and approval-duration plus status row using the card face URL from detail; logged updates.
[2026-01-15 15:13:58 -08:00] Assistant: Implemented the new card list item layout with cropped card face strip and overlapping rows, added card face/last-four/open-date fields to list state, and updated UI tests; logged updates.
[2026-01-15 16:14:57 -08:00] User: question: when I updated card info in card detail screen, then go bak to card list, I do not see changes reflecting on card item.
[2026-01-15 16:14:57 -08:00] Assistant: Identified that the list does not refresh on return and proposed adding an on-resume reload; confirmed to keep user tweaks in the list UI.
[2026-01-15 16:14:57 -08:00] User: yes i made those changes, you should keep the changes. proceed with refresh fix.
[2026-01-15 16:14:57 -08:00] Assistant: Added a lifecycle resume hook to reload the card list on return and wired it from MainActivity; updated tests and logs.
[2026-01-16 11:58:06 -08:00] User: it looks ok, but when card name gets longer and takes 2 lines, the placement is off. I do not want the overlap style anymore, make them separate rows.
[2026-01-16 11:58:06 -08:00] Assistant: Removed the overlap layout in card list items so the card face strip and text rows stack cleanly; logged updates.
[2026-01-16 14:05:12 -08:00] User: make each card item receive long press action. when user long press on card item, a option menu pops, which includes actions of delete the card and duplicate the card.
[2026-01-16 14:05:12 -08:00] Assistant: Added a long-press menu to card items with duplicate/delete actions, wired duplicate logic through repository/viewmodel/UI, and logged updates.
[2026-01-16 14:50:14 -08:00] User: align the dropdown menu to right and make the dropdown menu background white
[2026-01-16 14:50:14 -08:00] Assistant: Right-aligned the card list long-press menu anchor and forced a white menu background with black text; logged updates.
[2026-01-16 14:50:55 -08:00] User: also add icons to each dropdown menu item
[2026-01-16 14:50:55 -08:00] Assistant: Added Duplicate/Delete icons to the card list long-press menu items; logged updates.

[2026-01-17 00:35:55 UTC] User: I would like you to plan and implement new feature `Tracker`. Locate `Tracker` section in `feature_implementation.md` and update this section. Tracker screen can be accessed through bottom navigation bar. so bottom nav bar will have two entries, one goes to my card list and second goes to Tracker. Tracker screen maintains a list that contains Credit-type card benefits and card offers from profile card. Tracker screen will show three lists: Active trackers, Complete trackers and Expired trackers. Each tracker will be presented in one of the three lists. before updating the document, do you have a any questions?
[2026-01-17 00:35:55 UTC] Assistant: Asked about tracker status rules, offer handling, tracker display fields, tracker navigation, bottom nav visibility, profile selection, and library rule.
[2026-01-17 00:35:55 UTC] User: 1. each credit benefit and offer generates one tracker within a period of time. each tracker maintains a transaction list that users can add transactions to. a tracker is Active when transaction amount is smaller than tracker amount; Complete when equal or greater; Expired when the user is failed to use it within the period of time. for example, a Monthly benefit is provided to a user in Jan, but they are failed to use it until Feb. this benefit is Expired and mark the corresponding tracker to be Expired. For offers, forget about the offer status, but give a checkbox in offer tracker. Forget about the transactions in benefits. Trackers should use transactions. 2. forget about offer status. 3. card name, offer/benefit name, amount, time left towards the end date. 4. click on a tracker should open a tracker edit screen. 5. only on the Cards + Tracker tabs 6. default_profile 7. ignore the rule for now.
[2026-01-17 00:35:55 UTC] User: before you start coding, i want you to update the doc in Tracker section.
[2026-01-17 00:35:55 UTC] Assistant: Updated the Tracker section in `docs/feature_implementation.md` with bottom nav access, tracker sources, transaction-based status rules, period generation, and Tracker Edit flow details.
[2026-01-18 11:39:39 -08:00] User: # AGENTS.md instructions for E:\WorkSpace\Android_Studio_Workspace\ReawrdsRadar <INSTRUCTIONS> # Repository Guidelines  ## Project Structure & Module Organization - Root Gradle setup with single Android app module `app`. Settings in `build.gradle.kts`, versions via `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (managed by `libs` catalog). - Source under `app/src/main/java/com/example/rewardsrader`; Compose theme files live in `ui/theme`. - Resources in `app/src/main/res` (values, icons, XML rules). Product docs live in `docs/` (e.g., `product_functionality.md`), tooling in `tools/`.  ## Build, Test, and Development Commands - `./gradlew assembleDebug` ¨C compile the app and produce a debug APK. - `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` ¨C run JVM unit tests. - `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` ¨C run instrumented UI tests on an attached/emulated device. - `./gradlew lint` ¨C run Android lint checks. - Android Studio: use Compose Previews for quick UI iteration; standard Run/Debug targets use the `debug` build variant.  ## Coding Style & Naming Conventions - Kotlin + Jetpack Compose; prefer idiomatic Compose patterns (state hoisting, unidirectional data flow, small composables). - Indent with 4 spaces; keep lines concise and readable. Favor expression-bodied functions when clear. - Package paths mirror features; keep `MainActivity` lean and move UI/state into feature packages as they grow. - Use Material 3 components and the shared theme (`RewardsRaderTheme`) for colors/typography. Name composables as `FeatureActionScreen`, `FeatureActionCard`, etc. - Features are modularized; avoid oversized single files¡ªsplit UI/state/data by feature as they grow. - Instead of creating your own code, search for open-source libraries that can achieve the goal. downlod it to `reference` folder and use it.  ## Testing Guidelines - Unit tests: JUnit4 in `app/src/test/java`; name files `<Subject>Test.kt`. Aim to cover viewmodels/use-cases as they appear. - Instrumentation/UI tests: Compose UI Test + Espresso in `app/src/androidTest/java`; name files `<Subject>AndroidTest.kt`. Use `composeTestRule` with semantics tags for stable selection. - Keep tests deterministic; avoid network/file side effects. Use fakes for data sources when added.  ## Config & Data Notes - Card/benefit templates come from a maintained JSON/YAML config (see `docs/product_functionality.md`). Ship a bundled snapshot and allow optional URL/local overrides with validation and caching. - Store only non-sensitive card details; if sensitive identifiers are ever added, gate them behind local encryption/biometric unlock.  ## Mandatory Pre-work for Agents - Read all files in `docs/` - `docs/product_functionality.md` overall functionality. - `docs/architecture.md` each file's functionality and purpose. - `docs/feature_implementation.md` features. - `schema.prisma` system / database structure. - `schema.md` detailed description of database structure.  ## Logging - You should log what you did, current progress and conversation when you are given a command to do so. - Log each file's functionality, what's the purpose of each file in `docs/architecture.md`. - Log what features implemented, what changes you made to each file, progress so far in `docs/progress.md`. - Log our full conversation into `conversation-log.md` with date and time followed by message.   ## Skills A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill. ### Available skills - skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: C:/Users/DerivativeMarmot/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md) - skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: C:/Users/DerivativeMarmot/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md) ### How to use skills - Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths. - Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned. - Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback. - How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):   1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.   2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.   3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.   4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch. - Coordination and sequencing:   - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.   - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why. - Context hygiene:   - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.   - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.   - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice. - Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

[2026-01-18 12:05:42 -08:00] Assistant: Adjusted tracker loading to avoid flashing by skipping loading state on resume and loading tracker detail via LaunchedEffect.
[2026-01-18 12:23:55 -08:00] User: monthly, quartly, semi-annually, annually benefit expriation date are calculated in calendar date. assume today is 2/18/2026, monthly benefit will be expired on 3/1/2026 and then a new benefit will be generated and will have a expiration date of 4/1/2026. before you update tracker, do you have any questions?
[2026-01-18 12:23:55 -08:00] Assistant: Asked about calendar boundary alignment, partial period handling, expiration inclusivity, and anniversary/offer exceptions.
[2026-01-18 12:23:55 -08:00] User: 1. to be more specific, monthyly=1st to last day of current month. quarter=1/1-3/31 and 4/1-6/30 so on so forth. same rule for semi-annual and annual.  2. i want a partial tracker from the start date to the next boundary. 3. based on what i said in the first point, you should include the expiration date as the last day of effectiveness. 4. currently all benefit end date can not be mid-period, except anniversay benefit and offers. anniversary benefits and offers have a given and dynamic end date. do not factor those into the rules.
[2026-01-18 12:23:55 -08:00] Assistant: Updated tracker generation to align calendar-bound periods with partial first windows while keeping anniversary/offer dates dynamic.

2026-01-19 22:43 User: I noticed that current tracker manager creates multiple same benefit at once, for example, a monthly benefit from 1/1/2026 to 3/30/2026. it creates 3 trackers at once.

2026-01-21 16:42 Assistant: Asked for reminder timing, offset range, cancel behavior, schedule persistence, exact alarm fallback, and deep link handling.
2026-01-21 16:42 User: 1. allow user to select between 1-7 days 2. fires at 12:00 am. for example a tracker ends at 6/30 with a notification fires one day before. The alarm should fires on 6/29 12:00am. 3. yes reminders should be canceled if a tracker completes early or expires, and receiver should ignore non-active trackers. 4. new table, not only tracker uses notification, other modules use it as well. but that's a later topic. 5. `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` is optional. if it's denied, use inexact alarms. 6. yes open trackereditscreen by trackerId. update `feature_implementation.md` and then start coding.
